# PRODIGY_NT3
# Password Complexity Checker
This project is a Python tool designed to assess the strength of a password based on various criteria, including length, character variety, and common patterns. It was developed as part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech in Cybersecurity and Ethical Hacking.

# Features
Length Check: Ensures the password meets a minimum length requirement.
Character Variety: Checks for the inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Common Password Detection: Identifies easily guessable passwords (e.g., "12345", "password") and marks them as weak.
User Feedback: Provides feedback on how to strengthen the password.
